        <h1>Volunteer Opportunities</h1>
        <p>If you are looking for a way to connect with students and be part of a joyful learning environment, we would love to have you join us at the Emanuel Learning Center. All tutors are volunteers who come from a variety of backgrounds—many are college students, some are teachers, and others are professionals who love working with kids! Some speak Spanish fluently, while others may have no second language skills. Regardless of why they choose to tutor, all of our tutors share a vision of education that is student-centered, celebratory, and culturally responsive.</p>

        <p>Volunteers do not need any formal teaching or tutoring experience. We will provide an orientation and basic training to help you be the best possible tutor. We meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:45-7:00, and ask that tutors choose at least one of those days to attend regularly, though some tutors come for both nights. If you cannot make a regular commitment, you are also welcome to volunteer as a substitute and work with different kids when you are able to come. Substitutes are almost always needed! All tutors are required to pass a background check.</p>

        <p>Our students range from Kindergarten through Twelfth Grade, though most are in upper elementary and early middle school. We focus primarily on reading and math. The emphasis is on skill building rather than on homework help. This approach enables tutors to work with the student to develop capacities they will use every day in school, rather than solely on the next day. It also gives tutors more flexibility and creativity as they adapt the tutoring session to the individual needs and wants of the student. We center the relationship between the tutor and student, and learn through an internet program, games, writing, and reading. We want everyone to feel energized by tutoring, and this is an environment where substantial learning is paired with a lot of fun!</p>
